# BFG Project Status

## Production UI alignment hotfix

**Status:** LOCAL RELEASE CANDIDATE READY — PRODUCTION BLOCKED BY EXTERNAL AUTH/ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION

**Branch:** `hotfix/production-ui-alignment-v1`

**Release candidate:** `27a9463` (`fix: stabilize production auth rendering`)

**Functional source of truth:** current remote `main`, forward-integrated with
the existing `release/production-v1` product history because remote `main`
still pointed to the older prototype merge.

**Visual sources of truth:** the customer/admin mockups in `public/mockups`,
the official assets in `public/brand`, and selected visual patterns from
`origin/qa/ux-refinement-v0.1`. The QA branch is not a functional merge source.

**Product scope source:** the original PRD pack at
`/Users/masjak/Documents/BLESSINGFORGOOD/BFG WEB/context/product/` was audited
read-only. Its approved MVP scope, UX flows, design system, tone, and mascot
guidance are reflected in the local coverage matrices.

### Completed in the hotfix worktree

- Preserved the Phase 01–06.4 Clerk, RBAC, ownership, catalogs, Ready Stock,
  order, batch, tracking, invoice, deposit, payment, exception, profile,
  address, and audit domains.
- Removed browser-local product persistence, Preview/demo activation flags,
  prototype presentation, and the customer-side admin setup leak.
- Made a valid `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` the single product data path; missing
  configuration fails closed.
- Consolidated public and customer copy around Indonesian-first BFG language.
- Added `/account` with actionable order, invoice, deposit, exception,
  refund-obligation, and bounded cross-domain activity projections.
- Added `/admin/customers` and `/admin/customers/[customerId]` using existing
  server-authorized customer, profile, address, order, invoice, and exception
  queries.
- Rebuilt `/admin` around real operational queues without invented analytics.
- Added production-copy/runtime regression coverage.
- Restored official logo/mascot scale, mobile navigation, branded empty/loading
  states, a connected customer account hierarchy, and one compact admin shell.
- Rendered the optimized build at customer widths 375, 390, 430, 768, and 1440
  and protected admin widths 1024, 1280, and 1440.

### Current validation

- Vitest: 93/93
- Convex: 61/61
- Playwright responsive route smoke: 108/108 PASS
- Formatting: PASS
- Lint: 0 errors / 0 warnings
- TypeScript: PASS
- Next.js build: PASS (25 pages)
- `git diff --check`: PASS

### Customer experience finalization V1

- Inspected all eight local customer/mobile mockups under
  `public/mockups/mobile/` and documented their exact paths, visual rules,
  route parents, and brand asset relationships.
- Aligned the customer shell to the local mobile information architecture:
  five-item signed-in bottom navigation, safe-area/content offset, customer
  mobile menu links, and BFG-styled Clerk appearance.
- Public customer screenshots pass at 375, 390, 430, 768, and 1440 widths;
  the Ready Stock zero state remains intentionally empty and mascot-led.
- Authenticated account screenshot acceptance remains blocked by the existing
  matching Clerk/Convex environment requirement. No dummy business records or
  test production fixtures were created.
- Admin visual refinement is deferred; admin route regression remains covered
  by the full Playwright suite.

### Production boundary

`main` and Vercel Production remain untouched by design. Vercel Production has
zero environment variables; no matching Clerk Production pair, owned domain,
or canonical Convex Production deploy key/configuration is available. Public
rendered QA and local deterministic gates pass; authenticated customer/admin
rendered acceptance and Production smoke remain blocked. No alternate project,
dummy business data, Preview delivery, or staging deployment is used.

## Canonical Convex

Account: palevvi@gmail.com
Team: palevvi
Project: blessingforgood
Development: content-snake-214
Development reference: dev/masjak
Production: clean-eel-522
```

No similarly named project is authorized. If access is ambiguous, stop that
environment-sensitive operation instead of switching or creating a project.

## Current context

- **Objective:** converge Phase 01–06.4 logic and the approved visual direction
  into one releasable Production V1.
- **Decisions:** current `develop` logic wins; QA UX is a component/style donor;
  the official logo and mascot are mandatory; customer history is derived from
  canonical records; no financial history is rewritten.
- **Constraints:** no dummy business data, no invented refund/payout behavior,
  no wholesale QA-branch merge, no Preview/staging gate, and no `main` mutation
  before an explicit readiness report.
- **Open questions:** final customer-owned brand copy, unresolved business
  policies, Reporting/Excel, Analytics, and Ready Stock order recording.
- **Current priority:** configure one matching Clerk Production → canonical
  Convex Production → Vercel Production environment chain.
- **Next action:** after that external configuration is complete, rerun
  authenticated customer/admin screenshots and Production smoke; only then
  merge the approved candidate into `main` and push `main`.
